## Smoking: America's Leading Preventable Killer

- 480,000 deaths annually in the U.S.—that's 1 in every 5 deaths.
- $300 billion in economic costs each year.
- 34 million adults still smoke (14% of the population).
- Despite the risks, quitting remains a monumental challenge.

---

## Why Previous Incentive Programs Failed

- Prior studies had small sample sizes—limited power to detect effects.
- Incentives were paltry—as low as $10.
- Short-term focus without sustaining high cessation rates.
- Inconclusive evidence on long-term effectiveness.

---

## A Bold Experiment: Money as a Kickstart to Quit

Could substantial financial incentives significantly boost long-term smoking cessation rates? Volpp and colleagues (2009) set out to find out.

---

## Inside the Study Design

- Randomized controlled trial with 878 employees.
- Two groups: Information-only vs. Information plus incentives.
- Incentive group could earn up to $750 for quitting milestones.
- Follow-up duration: Up to 18 months.

---

## Recruiting Participants Ready for Change

- Employees aged 18+ smoking at least 5 cigarettes daily.
- Not using other tobacco products.
- Planning to stay with the company for 18+ months.
- Recruitment from February 2005 to November 2006.

---

## What Each Group Received

**Control Group:**
- Information on local cessation programs.
- Standard health benefits (e.g., medication coverage).

**Incentive Group:**
- Everything the control group received, plus:
- $100 for completing a cessation program.
- $250 for quitting within 6 months (confirmed biochemically).
- $400 for maintaining abstinence for an additional 6 months.

---

## Measuring Success: How They Tracked Quitting

- Regular check-ins at 3, 6, 9/12, and 15/18 months.
- Self-reported smoking status verified with cotinine tests.
- Cotinine: A reliable biomarker that confirms smoking cessation.

---

## Defining The Primary Endpoint

Successful cessation meant continuous abstinence from smoking, confirmed at both early (3 or 6 months) and later (9 or 12 months) follow-ups through negative cotinine tests.

---

## Secondary Outcomes Examined

- Enrollment and completion rates of cessation programs.
- Smoking cessation within the first 6 months.
- Long-term abstinence at 15 or 18 months.
- Effectiveness across different subgroups (age, income, etc.).

---

## The Results Are In: Incentives Triple Quitting Rates

- **9/12-month cessation rates:** 14.7% (incentive) vs. 5.0% (control).
- **Statistical significance:** P-value < 0.001.
- Substantial financial incentives made a significant difference.

---

## More Smokers Sought Help When Money Was at Stake

- **Program enrollment:** 15.4% (incentive) vs. 5.4% (control).
- **Program completion:** 10.8% (incentive) vs. 2.5% (control).
- Incentives boosted both participation and commitment.

---

## Early Quitters: Doubling Success in 6 Months

- **6-month cessation rates:** 20.9% (incentive) vs. 11.8% (control).
- Early financial rewards led to higher initial quitting success.

---

## Sustaining Quits: Long-Term Impact at 15/18 Months

- **15/18-month cessation rates:** 9.4% (incentive) vs. 3.6% (control).
- The incentive effect persisted even after payments stopped.

---

## Who Benefited? The Answer: Everyone

- No significant differences across age, gender, income, or smoking intensity.
- Incentives were effective across all examined subgroups.
- The strategy has broad applicability.

---

## Why This Study Matters

- Larger sample size provided sufficient power.
- Incentives were substantial enough to motivate change.
- Extended follow-up captured long-term effects.
- Rigorous biochemical verification ensured accuracy.

---

## The Employer's Perspective: Financial Sense

- Estimated savings of $3,400 per year per employee who quits.
- Benefits from increased productivity and reduced absenteeism.
- Healthier workforce leads to lower healthcare costs.

---

## Direct Payments Beat Premium Adjustments

- Immediate cash rewards are more motivating than insurance premium changes.
- Tangible incentives have a higher impact on behavior.
- Employees respond better to upfront rewards.

---

## Beyond Smoking: A Template for Health Behavior Change

- Potential applications for weight loss, exercise, medication adherence.
- Financial incentives could be a versatile tool in public health.
- Future studies needed to explore other areas.

---

## Limitations: What We Need to Keep in Mind

- Single company study may limit generalizability.
- Mostly white, higher-income participants.
- Voluntary participation might introduce selection bias.
- Higher-than-expected relapse rates observed.

---

## The Challenge of Relapse

- **Relapse rates between 9/12 and 15/18 months:** 35.9% (incentive) vs. 27.3% (control).
- Indicates that maintaining abstinence remains a challenge.
- Incentives kickstart quitting but may need reinforcement.

---

## Optimizing Incentives: Questions for Future Research

- What's the ideal incentive amount and structure?
- Would extended incentives prevent relapse?
- How do we tailor programs for diverse workforces?

---

## Final Verdict: Money Talks, Smokers Walk

Substantial financial incentives significantly increase smoking cessation rates. The evidence supports investing in such programs for real health gains.

---

## Key Takeaways for Employers

- Implementing financial incentives can improve employee health.
- Potential for significant cost savings and productivity gains.
- Enhances company image as a health-conscious employer.

---

## Rewriting the Playbook in Public Health

Financial incentives can revolutionize how we approach health behavior change. It's time to rethink traditional methods and embrace innovative strategies.

---

## Acknowledging the Ethical and Practical Challenges

- Ensuring fairness in who receives incentives.
- Balancing financial costs with health outcomes.
- Avoiding unintended consequences like gaming the system.

---

## Is the Investment Worth It? The Numbers Say Yes

- When the leading cause of preventable death is at stake, the potential benefits outweigh the costs.
- A small investment for a significant return in public health.

---

## A Call to Action: Make the Change

- Employers and policymakers, it's time to act.
- Implement programs that have proven effectiveness.
- If paying people to quit is more effective than other methods, it's unethical NOT to pay them.
