## The Nicotine Noose

### Smoking: Still Killing Us, Still Making Money

- 480,000 annual US deaths
- $300 billion in economic costs
- 34 million adult smokers (14% of population)
- Big Tobacco: $18 billion profit (2021)

You'd think we'd have solved this by now. We haven't.

---

## Past Attempts: A Comedy of Errors

### Previous Studies on Incentives: Small Change, Big Failure

- Tiny samples barely larger than a family reunion
- Incentives as low as $10 (what is this, 1950?)
- Short-term focus missing the relapse rollercoaster
- Inconclusive evidence (shocking, we know)

---

## Our Brilliant Plan

### Study Objectives: Show Me the Money

Primary: Does cold, hard cash keep cigarettes cold?

Secondary:

1. How quickly can we bribe people to quit?
2. Will they actually use those neglected cessation programs?
3. Who's most susceptible to our financial seduction?

---

## The Setup

### How We Rigged the Game

- 878 employees from a nameless corporate behemoth
- Control group: Here's a pamphlet, good luck
- Incentive group: Quit and we'll make it rain
- Up to $750 for kicking the habit

Because nothing says "we care" like conditional cash.

---

## Participant Casting Call

### Who Answered Our Siren Song?

- Recruited Feb 2005 - Nov 2006 (yes, this study is old enough to drive)
- Multiple US worksites (corporate drones unite!)
- Initial survey via company intranet
- On-site recruiting for the digitally challenged
- Voluntary participation (no arm-twisting, we promise)

---

## The Chosen Ones

### Our Criteria: Not Exactly "The Hunger Games"

- 18+ years old (sorry, teen smokers)
- 5+ cigarettes daily (casuals need not apply)
- No other tobacco products (we're purists)
- Sticking around for 18+ months (no quitters... except for smoking)
- Willing guinea pigs for our experiment

---

## The Grand Experiment

### What Our Lab Rats Experienced

Everyone got:

- A list of local "quit smoking" resources (how generous)
- Standard health benefits (don't get excited)

The lucky ones also received:

- Promises of cash for quitting
- Regular check-ins and spit tests (how dignified)

---

## Show Them the Money

### Our Bribe Structure (Don't Tell HR)

- $100 for completing a cessation program
- $250 for proven 6-month abstinence
- $400 for another 6 months smoke-free

Total possible payout: $750
(Less than a CEO's lunch budget, but hey, it's something)

---

## Stalking Our Subjects

### How We Hounded Participants

- 3-month check-in: "Still smoking?" (awkward)
- 6-month grilling for the stubborn ones
- 9 or 12-month interrogation + spit test
- 15 or 18-month final judgment

No, we're not overbearing at all.

---

## Trust, but Verify

### Lie Detector Test: Cotinine Edition

- Saliva or urine samples collected (yes, it's gross)
- Cotinine: nicotine's tattletale metabolite
- Must pass two tests to be declared smoke-free
- Because we trust you... but not really

---

## The Holy Grail

### Our Golden Ticket: Long-Term Quitting

Self-reported abstinence at both early (3 or 6 months) and late (9 or 12 months) check-ins, backed by negative cotinine tests. Because talk is cheap, but spit doesn't lie.

---

## Bonus Round

### Other Things We Measured (Because Why Not?)

- How many actually bothered with cessation programs
- Who stuck it out to the bitter end
- Early quitters vs. procrastinators
- The truly stubborn ones still smoke-free at 15-18 months
- Which subgroups were most easily bribed (for science, of course)

---

## Number Crunching

### How We Tortured the Data

- Intention-to-treat analysis (no take-backsies)
- Chi-square tests for yes/no questions
- Fancy t-tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum for the numbers folks
- Odds ratios: raw and prettied up
- Subgroup analysis (because everyone's special)

---

## The Chosen Few

### From Temptation to Trial

[Insert CONSORT-style flow diagram showing:]

- 1,903 curious cats
- 878 committed guinea pigs
- 436 potential cash cows
- 442 control group suckers
- Follow-up numbers (spoiler: they drop)

---

## Meet the Subjects

### Our Cast of Characters

- Average age: 44 (midlife crisis smokers)
- 55% male (slightly more Y chromosomes)
- 90% white (diversity, anyone?)
- 60% college-educated (yet still smoking)
- Mostly rich (>500% of poverty level)
- Pack-a-day habit (how quaint)
- 5-6% hardcore puffers (2+ packs/day)

---

## The Big Reveal

### Cash or Cancer: What Motivates More?

9 or 12-month quit rates:

- Money group: 14.7%
- Control group: 5.0%
- P-value: <0.001 (that's stats-speak for "Holy cow!")

Turns out, you can put a price on health. It's about $750.

---

## Desperation or Motivation?

### Did Money Make Them Try Harder?

Program enrollment:

- Cash cows: 15.4%
- Control group: 5.4%

Program completion:

- Money-motivated: 10.8%
- Self-motivated: 2.5%

Both differences statistically significant (p<0.001). Shocking, we know.

---

## The Sprint

### Early Quitting: A 6-Month Snapshot

6-month cessation rates:

- Incentive group: 20.9%
- Control group: 11.8%
- P-value: <0.001

Money: Motivating people to do what they should anyway since... forever.

---

## The Marathon

### Still Smoke-Free After All These Years (Well, Months)

15 or 18-month cessation rates:

- Cash-incentivized: 9.4%
- Control group: 3.6%
- P-value: 0.001

Even long-term, money talks and cigarettes walk.

---

## Equal Opportunity Bribery

### Does Money Motivate Everyone?

[Insert forest plot showing:]

Consistently higher quit rates for the cash crowd across:

- Age groups (from millennials to boomers)
- Gender (Mars and Venus both like green)
- Education levels (PhDs and GEDs unite)
- Income brackets (turns out, everyone likes free money)
- Baseline smoking intensity (from "social smokers" to chimneys)

No significant interactions. Cash is the universal language.

---

## The Bottom Line

### What We Learned (And Why Your CFO Should Care)

- Money motivates quitting (surprise!)
- Effects last longer than most New Year's resolutions
- Cash makes boring cessation programs suddenly appealing
- Works for pretty much everyone (equal opportunity corruption)
- Your workplace could be the next nicotine-free utopia

---

## Not Your Grandma's Smoking Study

### How We One-Upped Previous Research

- 878 participants (size matters)
- Up to $750 incentive (no more pocket change)
- 18-month follow-up (we're in it for the long haul)
- Biochemical verification (trust issues, much?)
- More numbers than you can shake a cigarette at

---

## The Spit Don't Lie

### Why We're Obsessed with Cotinine

- Nicotine's snitch, detectable for up to a week
- Eliminates the "I swear I quit" syndrome
- Confirms both short and long-term abstinence
- Makes our data actually believable
- Because "trust but verify" is our middle name

---

## Selling It to the C-Suite

### The Business Case for Bribing Quitters

Potential annual savings per ex-smoker:

- $3,400 in productivity gains
- Fewer sick days (and smoke breaks)
- Lower healthcare costs (lung cancer ain't cheap)
- Reduced fire hazard (we're only half-joking)
- Plus, you get to brag about your "wellness initiatives"

---

## Beyond the Butt

### Financial Incentives: Not Just for Nicotine Addicts

Potential applications:

- Paying people to lose weight (controversial, yet effective)
- Bribing employees to exercise (sweat for swag)
- Incentivizing medication adherence (quia pro quo)
- Rewarding preventive screenings (because early detection is priceless)
- Managing chronic conditions (cash for compliance)

Your CFO's nightmare, your CHRO's dream.

---

## The Fine Print

### Study Limitations (Or, How to Cover Our Academic Behinds)

- Single company (not exactly a cross-section of America)
- Participants whiter than a polar bear in a snowstorm
- More degrees than a thermometer
- Richer than your average Joe (or Jane)
- Self-selected guinea pigs (bias, anyone?)
- Potential for unintended consequences (smoking for hire, anyone?)
- May not work everywhere (results may vary, void where prohibited)

---

## What's Next?

### Future Research (Or, How to Keep Our Funding)

- Finding the Goldilocks zone of incentive size
- The 10-year plan: Do they stay quit?
- Crunching numbers: Is this actually cost-effective?
- Testing in diverse workplaces (not just corporate America)
- Combining cash with other quitting tools (money + e-cigs = ?)

---

## The Last Drag

### Cash for Quitters: Desperate Times, Desperate Measures?

Financial incentives work. They're not pretty, they're not cheap, but they get results. In a world where cigarettes still kill and Big Tobacco still profits, maybe it's time we fight fire with fire... or in this case, smoke with cold, hard cash.
