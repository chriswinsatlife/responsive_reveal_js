## The CLEAR Path to Effective Communication

When clarity matters, make your requests CLEAR:

- **Concrete**: Be specific; avoid vague terms.
- **Logical**: Organize your thoughts coherently.
- **Explicit**: State expectations plainly; no guessing games.
- **Actionable**: Provide steps that can be executed immediately.
- **Relevant**: Stick to what's essential; omit the rest.

## Putting CLEAR into Practice

- **Concrete**: Define exact deliverables, deadlines, and objectives.
- **Logical**: Provide a structured outline or key points.
- **Explicit**: Specify the purpose and target audience.
- **Actionable**: Include necessary data, resources, or access.
- **Relevant**: Focus on critical details; eliminate fluff.

## Why We Resist Being Specific

- **Fear of Limiting Creativity**: Worrying details will stifle innovation.
- **Assumed Understanding**: Believing others share your context.
- **Unclear Objectives**: Not knowing what you want yourself.
- **Time Constraints**: Rushing leads to skimpy instructions (which backfires).
- **Overconfidence**: Assuming "they'll figure it out"—spoiler: they won't.

## Stop Sabotaging Your Projects

1. **Clarify Your Needs**: Know what you want before you ask.
2. **Be Precise**: Provide detailed instructions with all necessary info.
3. **Use CLEAR as a Checklist**: Ensure nothing's overlooked.
4. **Invite Dialogue**: Encourage questions to eliminate ambiguities.
5. **Review Before Sending**: Double-check for clarity and completeness.

## The Illusion of Communication

> "The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place."
