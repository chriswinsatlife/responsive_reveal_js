## What is ARC-AGI?

ARC-AGI stands for Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence. It is a benchmark introduced by François Chollet in 2019 to measure AI's ability to acquire new skills on unknown tasks, aiming to assess progress toward general intelligence.

::: {.notes}
At the heart of our discussion is ARC-AGI—the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence. Conceived by François Chollet, ARC-AGI is more than a benchmark; it's a rigorous test of an AI's capacity to learn and generalize from novel situations. It challenges machines to step beyond preprogrammed responses and truly think.<break time="1.0s" />

## The Origins of ARC-AGI

In 2019, François Chollet, creator of Keras and AI researcher at Google, published the influential paper "On the Measure of Intelligence." He introduced ARC-AGI as a benchmark to evaluate AI systems on skill acquisition and adaptation to novel tasks, laying a foundation for progress toward AGI.

::: {.notes}
Back in 2019, François Chollet, renowned for creating Keras, penned a pivotal paper titled "On the Measure of Intelligence." In it, he proposed ARC-AGI as a way to rigorously evaluate an AI's ability to acquire new skills and adapt to unfamiliar challenges. This work laid a crucial foundation for measuring true intelligence in machines.<break time="1.0s" />
:::

## Measuring Intelligence

- Task-specific skill isn't true intelligence.
- Prior knowledge can mask a system's real capabilities.
- Intelligence is about generalization and learning new skills.
- We need benchmarks that test for novel skill acquisition.

::: {.notes}
Evaluating intelligence requires us to look beyond specialized skills. When a system excels only in areas it's been trained on, we can't ascertain its true cognitive abilities. Prior knowledge can obscure whether an AI is genuinely intelligent or just well-prepared. That's why benchmarks like ARC-AGI, which test for the acquisition of new skills, are essential—they reveal the capacity for true generalization and learning.<break time="1.0s" />

## Design of ARC-AGI

ARC-AGI tasks involve grid-based puzzles with input-output examples. Each grid cell can be one of ten colors, and grids range from 1x1 to 30x30 in size. The tasks require mapping inputs to outputs based on underlying patterns or rules.

::: {.notes}
ARC-AGI is ingeniously designed using grid-based puzzles that present a unique challenge. Each task consists of input-output pairs where grids of various sizes display patterns using ten possible colors. The objective is to decipher the underlying rules that map inputs to outputs, simulating how humans recognize and apply abstract reasoning to new problems.<break time="1.0s" />
:::

---

## Structure of ARC-AGI Tasks

- Each task includes several input-output pairs.
- Grids vary from 1x1 to 30x30 in dimensions.
- Each grid cell can be one of ten possible colors.
- Tasks require inferring the mapping from inputs to outputs.

::: {.notes}
Delving deeper, each ARC-AGI task provides multiple input-output examples, challenging the AI to infer the transformation rule. The grids, varying widely in size, offer a canvas where patterns emerge through the arrangement of colored cells. The AI must discern these patterns and apply them to new inputs, showcasing its ability to generalize from limited data.<break time="1.0s" />
:::

---

## How to Solve a Task

To solve an ARC-AGI task, produce a pixel-perfect output grid corresponding to the final input. Every cell's color and position must match exactly, including the correct grid dimensions. Precision is crucial.

::: {.notes}
Success in ARC-AGI hinges on precision. The AI must generate an output grid that flawlessly mirrors the expected result for a given input—every pixel counts. This requires not only understanding the underlying rule but also executing it with exactness. It's a stringent test of both comprehension and attention to detail.<break time="1.0s" />

## Core Knowledge Priors in ARC-AGI

- **Objectness**
- **Goal-Directedness**
- **Numbers & Counting**
- **Basic Geometry & Topology**

ARC-AGI tasks are based on innate human knowledge priors, reflecting fundamental cognitive abilities.

::: {.notes}
What makes ARC-AGI particularly challenging is that it leverages core knowledge priors—basic principles that humans innately possess. These include concepts like object permanence, intentionality, numerical understanding, and geometric intuition. By building tasks around these fundamental cognitive abilities, ARC-AGI assesses an AI's capacity to mimic human-like reasoning.<break time="1.0s" />
:::

---

## Objectness

Objects are consistent entities—they persist over time and don't appear or disappear without cause. Understanding objectness means recognizing that objects maintain their identity and can interact or remain separate based on context.

::: {.notes}
The concept of objectness is central to how we perceive the world. It's about recognizing that objects are stable and continuous—they don't spontaneously vanish or emerge. An AI needs to grasp this continuity to reason effectively about the environment and predict how objects will behave over time.<break time="1.0s" />
:::

---

## Goal-Directedness

Some objects are agents with intentions—they pursue goals. Distinguishing between animate and inanimate objects allows us to infer purpose and predict behavior.

::: {.notes}
Understanding goal-directedness elevates an AI's ability to interpret actions and anticipate outcomes. By discerning which elements in a scenario are acting with intent, the AI can infer motives and adapt its responses accordingly. This mirrors how humans interpret the actions of others, essential for nuanced reasoning.<break time="1.0s" />
:::

---

## Numbers & Counting

Understanding numbers allows us to count and compare objects based on attributes like shape or color. Basic arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction enable quantitative reasoning.

::: {.notes}
Numerical cognition enables us to quantify and evaluate the world around us. An AI must be able to count, compare quantities, and perform simple arithmetic to solve tasks that involve patterns or sequences. This quantitative reasoning is foundational for making sense of complex data.<break time="1.0s" />
:::

---

## Basic Geometry & Topology

Recognizing shapes and spatial relationships is fundamental. Objects can be mirrored, rotated, translated, combined, or repeated. Understanding geometry and topology helps in detecting patterns and transformations.

::: {.notes}
Spatial awareness allows an AI to perceive and manipulate geometric relationships. By understanding how shapes can be transformed—through rotation, reflection, translation—the AI can identify patterns that are not immediately obvious. This geometric reasoning is crucial for solving tasks that involve spatial manipulation.<break time="1.0s" />
:::

---

## Avoiding Cultural Biases

ARC-AGI tasks are designed to avoid reliance on language or specific cultural knowledge. They focus on innate human reasoning abilities, ensuring a fair comparison between humans and AI.

::: {.notes}
Importantly, ARC-AGI deliberately excludes cultural and linguistic biases. By focusing on universal cognitive skills, the benchmark provides a level playing field for evaluating intelligence across different systems. This ensures that success is due to genuine reasoning abilities, not pre-programmed knowledge or cultural familiarity.<break time="1.0s" />
:::

## The Impact of Solving ARC-AGI

*A Stepping Stone Toward AGI*

Solving ARC-AGI would revolutionize programming and automation. It would enable anyone, regardless of programming expertise, to create software by providing simple input-output examples. This new paradigm could democratize software development and drive unprecedented innovation.

::: {.notes}
Overcoming the challenges of ARC-AGI isn't just an academic exercise; it has profound practical implications. A solution would pave the way for a new era where creating software becomes accessible to all. By simply demonstrating the desired behavior through examples, people could harness the power of AI without needing to write code, unlocking immense creative potential.<break time="1.0s" />
:::

---

## A New Programming Paradigm

- Build software by providing a few input-output examples.
- Empower non-programmers to create and automate tasks.
- Develop programs that self-refine as they encounter new data.
- Mimic human learning in software systems.

::: {.notes}
This paradigm shift means moving from explicit programming to teaching by example. Just as we might show a colleague how to perform a task, we could show an AI, and it would generalize from those examples. Moreover, as the AI encounters new situations, it would continue to learn and adapt, much like a human refining their skills over time.<break time="1.0s" />
