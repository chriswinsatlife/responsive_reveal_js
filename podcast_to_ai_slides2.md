## The M&M's Effect: Environment Shapes Choices

Imagine a bowl of M&M's right next to you—you'd probably grab a handful. Place them across the room, and you might not bother. If everyone else is snacking, you're more likely to join in. Your desire for M&M's hasn't changed; the environment did. Your product's design is that environment. Craft it thoughtfully, and you'll influence user behavior effortlessly.

## Credit Karma's Game Changer: Simplifying Recurring Deposits

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Instead of urging users to make daily transactions, we focused on one impactful action: setting up recurring deposits. By redesigning the sign-up flow to highlight this option and making it effortless, we encouraged users to commit once and stay engaged. This one-time setup paved the way for sustained card usage.

## The Art of Choice: "Red Coat or Blue Coat?"

Ask a child, "Do you want to wear a coat?" and they'll likely say "No." Ask, "Do you want the red coat or the blue coat?" and suddenly they're choosing one. The same principle applies to your users. Presenting options guides behavior while making the user feel in control. It's not manipulation; it's smart design rooted in psychology.

---

## Optimize Onboarding: Critical Questions to Ask

1. **Where do users drop off** in the sign-up process?
2. **Is all requested information necessary** upfront?
3. **Are we communicating immediate benefits** clearly?
4. **How can we reduce cognitive load** at each step?
5. **Are we leveraging behavioral triggers** like social proof?

4. **Social Proof Deficit**: "Are others using this?"
5. **Inertia**: "I'll stick with what I know."
