## Great Minds Don't Work Alone

From Cicero to Jobs—Delegation Shapes History

History's most impactful figures leveraged others to amplify their influence.

::: {.notes}
Consider the likes of Cicero and Steve Jobs. Their monumental achievements weren't the result of solitary effort. They skillfully orchestrated the talents of those around them, leveraging delegation to leave an indelible mark on history.<break time="1.0s" />

## The Power Law of Human Accomplishment

- A few individuals contribute disproportionately to human progress.
- Their impact surpasses peers' by orders of magnitude.
- Observed in patents, market value, artistic works, and more.

::: {.notes}
In every field, from technology to the arts, a handful of individuals propel humanity forward by leaps and bounds. This isn't a mere doubling of output; it's an exponential difference—a power law in action. Their outsized influence is evident in the number of patents held, the market value they generate, and the masterpieces they create.<break time="1.0s" />

## Outliers Shape the Future

- **Albert Einstein:** Revolutionized physics by focusing on big ideas, not admin tasks.
- **Steve Jobs:** Transformed technology by delegating effectively to talented teams.
- **Leonardo da Vinci:** Despite genius, limited output due to lack of delegation.

::: {.notes}
These outliers—Einstein, Jobs, da Vinci—illustrate the spectrum of leveraging delegation. Einstein's profound focus on theoretical physics was possible because he delegated mundane tasks, allowing him to uncover the secrets of the universe. Jobs mobilized entire teams to realize his vision, revolutionizing technology. In contrast, da Vinci, while a genius, produced less than his potential by trying to do it all himself.<break time="1.0s" />

## Delegation Throughout History

- **Wright Brothers (1903):** Delegated engine design to Charles Taylor.
- **Charles Darwin (1850s):** Relied on an "army of fact gatherers."
- **Thomas Edison (1879):** Assistant sourced filament material from Japan.
- **Walt Disney (1928):** Delegated Mickey Mouse's design and initial animation.

::: {.notes}
Delegation isn't a modern invention; it's woven into the fabric of our greatest achievements. The Wright Brothers soared into aviation by entrusting Charles Taylor with the engine design. Darwin's revolutionary theories were supported by data from countless contributors. Edison didn't find the perfect filament alone; his assistant's global search led to success. Even Disney's iconic Mickey Mouse was the product of collaborative creation.<break time="1.0s" />

## Case Studies of Delegation

- **John Snow:** Assistant collected data critical to ending cholera epidemic.
- **Einstein:** Delegated mathematical formalization to Marcel Grossmann.
- **Henry Ford:** Assembly line innovations delegated to his team.

::: {.notes}
Further examples highlight the critical role of delegation in monumental successes. John Snow's groundbreaking work on cholera was enabled by his assistant's courageous data collection. Einstein leaned on Marcel Grossmann for the complex mathematics underpinning his theories. Henry Ford's assembly line—revolutionizing manufacturing—was a collective effort driven by his team's innovations.<break time="1.0s" />

## Leverage as a Moral Imperative

Maximizing Impact Through Others

- Delegation isn't optional—it's essential for maximal progress.
- Greatness multiplies its impact through others.
- Failing to delegate deprives society of valuable contributions.

::: {.notes}
Delegation transcends strategy; it becomes a moral imperative. In a world where time is finite but possibilities are infinite, leveraging others isn't just beneficial—it's essential. Great minds multiply their influence through delegation, and when they don't, society bears the cost of lost innovation and progress.<break time="1.0s" />
:::

---

## The Cost of Squandered Potential

- Delayed or unrealized inventions and ideas.
- Unique talents wasted on low-value tasks.
- Society loses out on advancements and innovations.

::: {.notes}
When great talents are mired in mundane tasks, the entire world pays the price. Delays in breakthroughs, unpursued ideas, and the misallocation of unique abilities hinder societal advancement. The cost isn't measured just in individual burnout but in the collective loss of progress we might have achieved.<break time="1.0s" />
